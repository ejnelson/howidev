### ðŸ’» Personal

#### What is your background, how did you become you?

I was raised in Lincoln Nebraska ðŸŒ½, my highschool was literally in the middle
of a cornfield near a town called Hickman. I came to the twin cities for
college, I ended up graduating with two bachelors degrees, one in Mathematics
and one in Mechanical Engineering. I was always pretty good at solving problems,
so I thought having two degrees would give me opportunities to do that even
though I didn't know what problems I want to solve specifically.

More importantly, I met a girl at church during my time at college and we are
married now with one kid and another on the way! ðŸš¸

### ðŸ’» Professional

#### What does a typical workday look like?

I'm currently between jobs, but I think ideally it would be:

- wake up at 5:00am then workout immediately before my body realizes what its
  going through
- breakfast with fam. 6:00am to 7:00 am
- work by 7:30am-ish so I can have some focus time before meetings start,
  usually around 9:30am.
- scrum/plannings/retros and other meetings usually happen between 9:30am and
  11:30am
- break/lunch at noon
- focus/collab time after lunch, random meetings
- depending on how much work I have or how productive I was that day, I will
  take an hour or two to work on personal stuff before I leave.
- pick up my kid from daycare and am home by 5:30pm
- fam time until the kid goes down for bed at 7:30pm
- #adulting until around 8-8:30pm
- beat myself up for not getting anything done while watching netflix with my
  wife until bedtime around 9:30-10:00pm.
