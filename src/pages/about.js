        How I Dev is blog about developers, by developers. Each entry is written
        by a different developer answering the question:{' '}

        I think as developers, and therefore perpetual learners, one of the
        great sources of knowledge and inspiration is to see how other people do
        stuff! Don't we all go to StackOverflow to see how other Devs write
        code? Maybe we can all go to How I Dev to see how other Devs work in
        code.

      <StyledSpan>
        And of course as developers we all love open source, a great (easy) way
        to get into if you haven't is to contribute to this blog.

        You could get inspiration or knowledge from this project by:
