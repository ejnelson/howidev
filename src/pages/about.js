      <br />I was in need of some inspiration one day and thought some of my
      fellow developers might be too. You could get inspiration from this
      project by <br />
      1. being able to contribute to an open source project (Pull requests
      welcome) <br />
      2. being able to contribute to the blog (best way to contribute is to
      actually make a pull request with your blog entry, I will take
      email-entries though as well erik@ejnelson.com) <br />
      3. reading the blog posts of other developers
